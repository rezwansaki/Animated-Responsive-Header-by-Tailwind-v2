# Animated Responsive Header - Tailwind CSS v2
Animated Responsive Header is a HTML template with a toggle button like bootstrap. I am using jquery for animation. 

# How to use:
    1. Copy this project and paste it another place
    2. Need to change the project name of my new project 
    3. run 'npm install' in the terminal 
    4. run 'npm run tw:build' in the terminal 
    5. run 'npm run tw:watch' in the terminal 
    6. Now do your work with html, js, images etc from public folder and you can also serve or open html file from that (public) folder
    7. Open new terminal and run 'npm run tw:prod' for production (to use as a final html template)
    8. Finally rename the public folder and use as a html template

Thanks to tailwindtoolbox for basic template. 
I got an idea from that basic template of tailwindtoolbox, then I work on it. I used jQuery.
